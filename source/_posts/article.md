# 记笔记

## 为什么要记笔记

​		学习的过程中,就是获取新的信息的过程.如果我们要将学习的信息更长久的记住和拿来使用,那么输入和输出同样重要,记笔记可以帮助我们更好的理解和记忆这些学习到的新的信息,也方便我们以后需要的时候能够快速的找到并回忆起来.

​		Learning process is the process that input new information to our brain. Input and output are equally important if we want the information we learned could be longly remembered and used. Taking notes can not only help me understand and memory these information learned newly, but also help me could quickly find and memory when we need.

## 打字记笔记 vs 手写记笔记

​		我们获取知识的方式是通过各种语言,这些语言传递了信息以及语言本身的语法和发音等信息.而我们人类同一时间能处理的信息是有限的,通过打字记笔记可以更快速的输入语言,但是我们会将更多的注意力集中在语言的语法和发音上.手写笔记因为记录文本的速度受到限制,我们会将更多的注意力集中在语言所传递的信息上.因此,手写笔记会有一种天然的优势来帮助我们更好的去理解笔记.打字记笔记也可以练习和改进这些弊端.

​		There are two aspects of the information being presented when we pay attention to lecture, information and language whit syntax and sounds. Our working memory could only  handle limited information in one time . Typing out you note will let you have to pay more attention to language because of typing speed, and handwritten notes will let you take more attention to information's mean by limiting you handwriting speed.

## 记笔记的方针

### 课堂笔记

- 预习课堂上将要学习的内容

- 注意教学大纲

- 关注学习指南和复习已有的笔记

- 脑中记住不同的题型

  

- Gauge each class you're taking early on

- Carefully look at the syllabus

- Pay attention to any study guide or review materials

- Make mental notes about different type of questions tests

### 阅读笔记

- 重要思想、总结和结论
- 要点列表
- 专业术语和定义
- 例子

​		在应用和实践性比较强的学科中，要格外注意例子中的细节，这可以有效的扩充我们用所学的知识去解决相应问题的武器库



- BIG IDEAS - SUMMARIES, OVERVIEWS, OR CONCLUSIONS

- BULLET LISTS

- TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

- EXAMPLES

  In classes where you have to apply concepts and formulas to problems, by recording every detail of the examples you see in class as well as making side notes about why the concepts being used work, you will have a lot more ammunition to work with while you're tackling those homework problems.

## 记笔记的方法

### Outline method

​		Recording the details of the lecture or book you're reading in a bullet list. Each main point will be a top-level bullet, and underneath it you'll indent further and further as you add more details and specifics.

​		Using formatting tricks to make important details stand out when you're reviewing them later on.(bold, color, etc)

### Cornell method

​		Dividing paper or a table into three distinct sections,the Cue Column, the Notes Column, and the Summary Column. 

**Notes Column**

- record the lecture here
- concise sentences, shorthand symbols
- abbreviations
- lists

**Cue Column**

- main ideas
- questions that connect points
- diagram
- prompts to help you study

### Mind-Mapping method

​		Mind maps are diagrams that visually represent the relationships between individual concepts and facts.

​		Writing the main concept smack-dab in the middle of the page, and then branch out from there to flesh out the details.



# 阅读

## 阅读时应该看哪里

​		可以将需要阅读的材料分成两部分，主要阅读和补充阅读，对于补充阅读只需要选择性的阅读即可。

​		Dividing reading into two groups, main textbook and supplemental reading.

**READING HIERARCHY**

1. ARGUMENT
2. DESCRIPTION
3. CONTEXT

## 提高阅读速度

​		受限于人的生理机制，阅读速度也会受到限制，只能通过大量的阅读合适的材料来提升阅读的速度。让大脑自己去适应调整，自适应的省略一些没有太多意义的虚词来提高阅读速度。此外，在阅读时定时可以减少发呆提高阅读的专注力。

​		Reading often, reading widely and less daydreaming ( set a time goal for the chapter ).

​		Your working memory can only process so much at once. You need give your working memory time to deal with each chunk that comes in before feeding it another one, and you do this by pausing frequently. 

​		根据阅读的信息的优先级，可以适当的选择精度和略读来提高整体的阅读速度。

​		pseudo-skimming technique.

## 记住阅读的内容

### 划重点

Highlighting

​		当我们看没有看过的资料的时候，往往会划非常多的重点，这会导致我们误以为自己记住了这些重点，反而降低了记忆的效率。所以需要特别谨慎的划重点。

​		The problem is that it's really easy to highlight too much since everything seems important when you're first reading is.

### 摩斯密码法

Morse code

​		阅读过程中遇到有趣的观点或者结论在旁边用小点标记，后续遇到了相关的描述和例子来说明这个观点就可以使用小横杠来标记。

​		First, if you come across a sentence that seems to be laying out a big, interesting idea, draw a quick dot next to it in the margin of the book. Secondly if you cone across an example or explanation that supports the previous big idea, draw a quick dash next to it in the margin, instead of a dot.

### 主动阅读

SQ3R

对于概念性的阅读，适合更多的总结性笔记，而对于事实描述性的阅读则更适合更加详细的笔记。

# MEMORY

Brain turns information into memories by putting it through a few different stages.
## SENSORY MEMORY
- Process pretty much everything your senses detect or experience in the real world.

- Has the attention span of a five-year-old at the MV;

  most of what it takes in is lost almost immediately.
  
- What dosre stick moves into short-term or working memory.

Work memory can really only handle 4-7 bits or items of infomation at one time.

Could increase by grouping bits into chunks.



## LONG-TERM MEMORY 

The process of short-term memory turning into long-term memory would causes pyhsical changes within brain . Could increase by exercise but need to take time.  Interval learning could better to form long-term memory.

## FEATURE OF MEMORY
1. Brain latches more readily onto things that are tangible, visual, and uncommon than it does with the abstract or the mundane.
2. The more connections that lead to a memory, the strong it'll be .
3. Memories fade away unless you repeatedly recall them.



## STORAGE STRENGTH AND RETRIEVAL STRENGTH

Storage strength will not weaken, once a memory is encoded, the neural pattern can onlystronger.

Retrieval strength will fadw with time, could increase by organize or recall the memory.

## HOW TO DO

- Interval learning

- Write out a summary of what you've learned from memory

- empahsis on practicing with real problems

  

## PLANNING AND ORANIZATION
- GTD



# FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION

## ATTENTION TYPE

- passive attention

​	automatically fouces on something

- postive attention

​	top-down attention to focus on something, 

### ATTENTION-SELF

Brain activates inhibitory mechanisms to block out competing stimuli.

directed attention fatigue.

### INCREASE ATTENTION-SELF

**Factors**

- your environment

- your tendency to seek novelty when bored

- your interest in the task

- your brain's current state

- how long you've been focusing

**How to do**

- stop multi-tasking
- tailor your environment for better focus
- break your current task down into smaller chunks
- learning to resist cravings for novelty

- high quality work = time spent x intensity of focus
